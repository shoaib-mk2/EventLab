###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: `{}`

<i>JavaScript has two scopes which are the local scope and global scope and when we directly assign a variable without declaring, it becomes a global property of the window object. The window is the object of the browser. It is not the object of JavaScript. It is automatically created by the browser and it can be accessed from anywhere on the web page. Assigning "greetign = {};" without declaring it makes "greetign" as a global variable. So the output will be "{}".</i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: `"12"`

<i>The "sum" function takes two parameters a and b to add them. In JavaScript, when you use the "+" operator with a string and another type (like a number), it will perform concatenation, that'll convert the non-string value to a string. In this case, 1 (a number) is converted to a string and "2" is already a string, so they are concatenated and the output is "12".</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`

<i>The "food" array remains unchanged. It still holds the original values. However, the "info.favoriteFood" property is modified to "🍝" in the info object. When you log the food array it remains the same and the first element in info is "🍝". But it doesn't affect the food array itself.</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B: `Hi there, undefined`

<i>The "sayHi" function expects an argument name but when called without any argument, name is undefined. Therefore, the template string will include undefined. So the output will be "Hi there, undefined" when logged to the console.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C: 3

<i>The "forEach" method iterates through the elements of the "nums" array. The condition if (num) checks if the element is truthy. There are three truthy elements in the "nums" array (1, 2, and 3). So count is incremented three times and the output is "3".</i>
